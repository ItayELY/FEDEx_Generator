# Fedex Genarator
### Introduction
FEDEx Genarator is a system that assists in the process of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) sessions. Based on FEDEx work (https://github.com/TAU-DB/FEDEx), it gives the user the option togenerate NL explanations + Visualizations to their queries (Filter/GroupBy/Join) results.

### The PD-EXPLAIN Python library
FEDEx is now a part of PD-EXPLAIN! an easy-to-use Python wrapper for Pandas. 
Install by:
```bash
  pip install pd-explain
```
For more information, visit the [PD-EXPLAIN](https://github.com/analysis-bots/pd-explain) Github page


### How it works
FEDEx generator is forked from on FEDEx system, and offer new process to get explanation:

1. The user users the query (Filter/GroupBy/Join) operation, gives it the input dataframe, output dataframe and the query parameters
3. FEDEx calculates an Interestingness Measure (that works well with the specific operation, for example Exceptionality measure for Filter and Join operations) for every column in the output dataframe (the query result)
4. FEDEx finds the most interesting columns and partition them to set of rows.
5. Then it finds the set-of-rows that affects the Interesingness measure result the most (from [2]).
6. Now FEDEx takes the top columns and set-of-rows and generates meaningful explanations

For the full details, you can either view the code or read the FEDEx article which will be referenced here really soon:)

### Example
We used the spotify dataset from Kaggle.
The first operation of our user was `SELECT * FROM Spotify WHERE popularity > 65;`

The raw output (Snip) -

The generated explanation -

The second operation of the user was `SELECT AVG(dancability), AVG(loudness) FROM [SELECT * FROM Spotify WHERE year >= 1990] GROUPBY year;`

The raw output (Snip) -

![GroupBy output](Images/groupby_result.jpg)

The generated explanation -

### Usage

**Notice** - This project was tested on python version 3.6-3.8. 

First, you have to install the requirements - `py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Secondly, you should install latex on your system (the explanations inside the graphs require that). Things will still work even without latex but the experince might be a bit inferior.

For now, you can view usage examples at `Notebooks` folder and at `UserStudyInteractive.py`.  We are currently working on a better API that will allow users to use pandas and generate explanations without effort and without using additional dedicated API. You can get sense of how it will work at the `Interactive` notebooks. You should use the functions `join`, `filter_` and `group_by`. If you want to disable FEDEX-Sampling - you should set `SAMPLE` global variable at `UserStudyInteractive.py` to 0. 

Notice that `UserStudyInteractive.py` was designed to be used inside a jupyter notebook, so you should use jupyter notebook or to make several minor changes.
